Thank you for purchasing FPS Handy Hands.

FPS Handy Hands is a set of posable high quality first person hand models. The following prefabs are included-

hand_left_prefab
hand_right_prefab
hand_leftandright_prefab
female_hand_left_prefab
female_hand_right_prefab
female_hand_leftandright_prefab

These models are designed to be posable in the Unity editor. To pose the hands, simply expand the hierarchy of the hand model in your scene by clicking the triangle next to the hand name in the Hierarchy panel. Keep expanding until you come across the desired transform node, and move it around with the standard Unity Move and Rotate tools. When posing the hands, it will easier if Unity is set to "Pivot" rather than "Center", and "Local" rather than "World".
